# Mikrolokaal

Semester 4 - Game Design and Technology - Industry Project (Spring 2022)

## Overview

**Mikrolokaal** is an educational game intended for children to play and understand (the balancing part of) microbiotics. 
The game is played in the classroom with 2 people per tablet with a maximum of 15 tablets. In addition we have one big screen for a bigger overview. There is a moderator (host) who explains the game and can change variables while playing to guide the experience. The second screen experience can also be enhanced.
